\section{African Diversity Reference Panel}
\label{sec:adrp}

In this section I present an expansion on the preliminary work on the generation of a continent specific reference panel done with the 3 African populations as part of the \gls{AGV} project. Here I present plans to generate such a reference panel consisting of 14 different African ethnolinguistic groups.
