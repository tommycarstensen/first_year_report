\section{Rationale}

With next generation genotyping, and the decline in genotyping costs, it has now become possible to carry out large-scale dense genotyping across individuals for genome wide association studies. While these chip designs capture variation in European populations very well, their utility in capturing variation in more diverse African populations is unclear. Using the African Genome Variation Project resource (AGVP), we have shown that existing chip designs with imputation using large-scale sequencing panels can capture common variation well relative to low coverage sequencing designs. We also show marked improvement in imputation accuracy, even for common variation, with addition of diverse African populations in imputation panels.\cite{Gurdasani2015}

We hypothesise that development of more efficient chip designs specific to African populations would complement the development of novel reference panels, and improve efficiency of variant capture by genotyping arrays even further. While existing chip designs have included African populations in the ascertainment set, European populations have dominated development of these arrays, and African populations in current reference panels are not representative of more differentiated population groups within Africa. Here, we describe the development of such an array, ascertained on large samples from distinct representative population groups across Africa.
