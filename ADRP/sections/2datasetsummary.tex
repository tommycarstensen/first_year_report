\section{Summary of Datasets}
The chip design will incorporate several population groups collated from different parts of Africa. These include samples collated as part of the AGVP\cite{Gurdasani2014}, the 1000 Genomes project (\href{http://www.1000genomes.org}{http://www.1000genomes.org}),
% the Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP),
% the Simonâ€™s Foundation (\href{http://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-genome-diversity-project-dataset/}{http://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-genome-diversity-project-dataset/}),
 and other shared or publicly available data. These samples have been chosen to be representative of diverse ethnolinguistic and geographical groups across Africa. All samples will constitute the reference panel described in the tag SNP selection section, but tag SNPs will only be selected from populations with 50 samples or more. The chip efficiency will be validated with the remaining populations.
