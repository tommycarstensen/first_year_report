\section{Validation of selected tag SNPs}

As sequence data, particularly low coverage short read data has been prone to sequencing errors, we will validate all tagging sites based on a large data repository of validated variant sites collated by the vendor. Novel variant sites will be further validated by the vendor, prior to chip design, and proxies of sites that cannot be covered will be investigated and filled in for generation of the final array.
