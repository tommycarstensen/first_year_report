\subsection{Quality control after variant calling and genotype refinement}
If SNP array data is available, we further check after genotype refinement with Beagle4 that the concordance and correlation between chip and sequence genotypes is greater than 0.98 and 0.95 respectively for each sample. We also check for heterozygosity outliers (\textgreater3SD per population) and PCA outliers after genotype refinement. Variant calling and genotype refinement is repeated if a sample either fails the check of genotype concordance, which is a sign of poor data quality, or fails the check of heterozygosity, which can be a sign of sample contamination or a population outlier.
