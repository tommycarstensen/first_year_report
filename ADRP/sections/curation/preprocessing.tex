\subsection{Alignment and preprocessing of reads}
All sequence data generated in house will be processed homogenously to avoid pipeline related artifacts. Following generation of raw reads mapping will be carried out to the human reference genome (GRCh37) using the BWA-MEM algorithm of the BWA software package, which is suitable for Illumina reads longer than 70bp.\cite{2013arXiv1303.3997L}
