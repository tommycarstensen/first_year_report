\subsection{Discussion}

We have shown low coverage data to be a viable method for capturing common variation. As sample sizes grow, the step involving refinement of genotype probabilities after variant calling will however grow to be very costly. To capture singletons and other rare variants and to avoid a computationally demanding refinement step the conclusion is to avoid low coverage data and instead sequence to 15x or 30x coverage.
