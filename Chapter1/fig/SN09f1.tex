\caption[Variant calling flow diagram.]{Work flow for variant calling across the low coverage \gls{WGS} data from 3 populations. Following read mapping and bam improvement, calling was carried out across all populations using \gls{UG}. This was followed by \gls{VQSR} based filtering with \gls{GATK} and genotype likelihood refinement with Beagle. Figure created by Deepti Gurdasani.}
