\caption{Correlation between 4x Bagandan sequence data and Omni2.5M genotypes, when using different algorithms for genotype refinement (Beagle v3, Beagle v3 followed by IMPUTE2, IMPUTE2 alone). Using Beagle alone for genotype refinement appears to produce the most accurate genotype likelihoods. Addition of IMPUTE2 does not provide any added advantage.}
