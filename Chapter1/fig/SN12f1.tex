\caption[Work flow for evaluation of \gls{ULC} designs.]{Flow diagram for curation and comparison of low coverage and \gls{ULC} \gls{WGS} data. All three populations were called together for 4x, 2x, 1x, and 0.5x coverage. For 8x coverage, 120 Ethiopian samples were called separately using the  same  work flow. \gls{ULC} sequencing data was compared with low coverage sequencing data regarding ability to capture variants; i.e. sensitivity. To further assess accuracy of genotype capture, genotype calls were compared with those from the Illumina Omni 2.5 genotype array for overlapping sample sets. Figure created by Deepti Gurdasani.}
