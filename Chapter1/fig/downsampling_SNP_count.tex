\caption[Down-sampling and loss of rare variants in the Ethiopian samples.]{Left: Venn diagram showing intersections between call sets at different coverages. Right: \gls{SNP} count in the Ethiopian population at different coverages in different \gls{MAF} bins after calling and filtering of variants with \gls{GATK} UnifiedGenotyper and VariantRecalibrator.\cite{DePristo2011} The y-axis is logarithmic. The ability to call rare variants is impaired at lower coverages.}
