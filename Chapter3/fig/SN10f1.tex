\caption[Imputation accuracy for different populations as a function of \gls{MAF} and \glssymbol{FST}.]{Figure a shows the imputation accuracy into the Omni 2.5M genotype array for different populations using the \gls{1000G} reference panel. Figure b depicts the correlation between the mean weighted \glssymbol{r2} across the array and the minimum genetic distance of each population from the reference panel. \glssymbol{FST} values calculated by Deepti Gurdasani and Savita Karthikeyan.}
