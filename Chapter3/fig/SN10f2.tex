\caption[Reduction in imputation accuracy on thinning the Illumina Omni 2.5M chip data to Illumina OmniExpress.]{Reduction in imputation accuracy on thinning the Illumina Omni 2.5M chip data to Illumina OmniExpress (~650,000 sites) when using the \gls{1000G} phase 1 reference panel. There is clear reduction in accuracy observed in all populations, with the reduction in accuracy being greater for certain populations (Zulu and Jola) compared to others (Igbo and Baganda). The reduction in accuracy appears to be related to the genetic distance of a given population to the reference panel, arguing that denser SNP arrays may be required for more accurate imputation in populations poorly represented in reference panels.}
