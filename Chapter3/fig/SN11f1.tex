Improvement in imputation accuracy for each population using two different reference panels as a function of difference in minimum \glssymbol{FST} between each population in either of the two reference panels.]{
Correlation between the improvement in imputation accuracy with the merged reference panel as a function of the difference in minimum \glssymbol{FST} relative to populations constituting the \gls{1000G} reference panel and the merged reference panel. \glssymbol{FST} values calculated by Deepti Gurdasani and Savita Karthikeyan.}
