To further inform the design of genetic studies in Africa we sequenced samples from three distinct sub Saharan African populations in the East (Baganda), South (Zulu) and North (Ethiopia) and generated a continent-specific reference panel. One of the reasons for designing a haplotype reference panel is that the accuracy of imputation and the accuracy of downstream analyses - e.g. the ability to identify novel association signals in a \gls{GWAS} - improve significantly, which has been shown previously.\cite{Jallow2009}\cite{Gurdasani2015} The presence of African populations in existing reference panels is sparse. To generate an improved reference panel we used low coverage data (4x) from the 3 populations (page \pageref{sec:agv_data_description}) to generate a reference panel merged with phase 1 of 1000G.\cite{1000G2012}
