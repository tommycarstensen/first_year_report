\section{Prepatory generation of a reference panel for the African continent}
\label{sec:reference_panel}

\subsection{Introduction}
Variants can be imputed to a greater accuracy with a population specific reference panel.\cite{Jallow2009} The genetic variation in humans in Africa is greater than anywhere else on the planet.\cite{Gurdasani2015} Therefore development of a continent specific reference panel for the African continent could be seen as being more important than anywhere else. Here I explore the development of such a reference panel using low coverage sequencing reads from 3 geographic parts of Africa and \gls{1000G}\cite{1000G2012} low coverage variant calls from another 2 populations in Africa.
