\section{Introduction}
As shown in table \ref{tab:chip_SNPs} on \pageref{tab:chip_SNPs), figure \ref{fig:SN02f2} and elsewhere\cite{Gurdasani2015} approximately 20\% of the autosomal SNPs on the Illumina HumanOmni2.5 SNP array are monomorphic in African populations. And as shown in figure \ref{fig:SN10f2} on page \pageref{fig:SN10f2} SNP density also alters imputation accuracy quite significantly. Therefore we wish to explore whether a continent specific array can capture variation in African populations better.

\section{Discussion}
If more time and additional sequencing data had been available at the time of analysis, then it would have been interesting to compare the imputation accuracy, when using the Omni2.5M SNPs and the 1 million selected tag SNPs as an imputation scaffold. Given the large number of monomorphic SNPs on the Omni2.5M array and the European ascertainment bias, then it is expected, that the 1 million continent specific tag SNPs might perform better in terms of imputation accuracy.
