Future work will involve design of a 1st generation SNP array in collaboration with H3A Africa as described.

Future work will also involve analysis of genomic location and time of viral introgression, analysis of mutational effects of nsSNPs on protein structures; i.e. changes in binding energies ($\Delta\DeltaG_{binding}$), etc.

Find homologous protein structures using \gls{VEP} annotations and search a local \gls{PDB} metadata archive for these annotations. Alternatively I will use a pre-release \gls{PDB} web server, which is in preparation according to private communication with Rachel Kramer Green at the \gls{wwPDB}.

In the past there has been many \gls{GWAS} publications on the identification on association signals, but as the novel discovery rate decreases, then it is not unlikely that we will see a further shift towards structural characterization of variants.\cite{Teng2009}\cite{Kucukkal201518} A structural characterization of variants would provide valuable drug targets for pharmaceutical companies and enable further customisation of drugs based on genotype through structure based drug design.\cite{Kuntz21081992} I want to pursue this, because I believe this is a new strand of public health genomics, which has the potential to have a large positive impact in just a few years from now on public health.
