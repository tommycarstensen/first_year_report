\label{chap:future}

Future work will involve design of a 1st generation SNP array in collaboration with H3A Africa as described.

Future work will also involve analysis of genomic location and time of viral introgression, analysis of mutational effects of nsSNPs on protein structures; i.e. changes in binding energies ($\Delta\DeltaG_{binding}$), etc.
