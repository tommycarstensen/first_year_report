\caption[Site frequency spectrum of sequence and SNP array data]{Site frequency spectrum derived directly from 4x \gls{WGS} data and SNP array data for the populations Uganda, Zulu and Ethiopia. Ascertainment bias against detection of rare variation on the SNP array is seen. On the x-axis is the number of alleles. On the y-axis is the relative frequency for each allele count.}
