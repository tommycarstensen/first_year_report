\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction_chip}

As shown in table \ref{tab:chip_SNPs} on page \pageref{tab:chip_SNPs}, figure \ref{fig:SN02f2} and elsewhere\cite{Gurdasani2015} approximately 20\% of the autosomal SNPs on the Illumina HumanOmni2.5 SNP array are monomorphic in African populations. And as shown in figure \ref{fig:SN10f2} on page \pageref{fig:SN10f2} \gls{SNP} density also alters imputation accuracy quite significantly. Therefore it is desirable to explore whether a continent specific \gls{SNP} array can capture variation in African populations better. I do so here.
