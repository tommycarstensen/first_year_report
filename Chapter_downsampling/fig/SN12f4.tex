\caption[Sensitivity and specificity for each of 3 populations relative to 4x after down-sampling.]{Same as figure \ref{fig:SN12f4} relative to 4x data; i.e. sensitivity and specificity for different \gls{ULC} sequencing designs, and imputed data from the Omni 2.5M \gls{SNP} array relative to 4x \gls{WGS} data from populations Zulu (top), Uganda (middle) and Ethiopia (bottom). Sensitivity and specificity is defined in the text and illustrated in figure \ref{fig:SN12f2} on page \pageref{fig:SN12f2}.}
