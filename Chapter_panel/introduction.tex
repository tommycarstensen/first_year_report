\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:rp_introduction}

Variants can be imputed to a greater accuracy with a population specific reference panel.\cite{Jallow2009} The genetic variation in humans in Africa is greater than anywhere else on the planet.\cite{Gurdasani2015} Therefore development of a continent specific reference panel for the African continent could be seen as being more important than anywhere else.

To further inform the design of genetic studies in Africa we sequenced samples from three distinct sub Saharan African populations in the East (Baganda), South (Zulu) and North (Ethiopia) (table \ref{tab:sequence_sample_summary} on page \pageref{tab:sequence_sample_summary}) and generated a continent-specific reference panel. One of the reasons for designing a haplotype reference panel is that the accuracy of imputation and the accuracy of downstream analyses - e.g. the ability to identify novel association signals in a \gls{GWAS} - improve significantly, which has been shown previously.\cite{Jallow2009}\cite{Gurdasani2015} The presence of African populations in existing reference panels is sparse. To generate an improved reference panel low coverage (4x) data from the 3 \gls{AGV} populations (page \pageref{sec:agv_data_description}) was used to generate a reference panel merged with phase 1 of \gls{1000G}.\cite{1000G2012}

On page \pageref{sec:adrp} I further present the plans on development of a greatly improved reference panel using low coverage sequencing reads from 9 African ethnicities and \gls{1000G} phase 3\cite{1000G2015} low coverage variant calls from another 5 populations in Africa.
